--          how severe the problem is per column.
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────

-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────
-- SECTION 4: CATEGORICAL COLUMN PROFILING
-- Purpose: Find all distinct values and spot
--          inconsistencies — typos, mixed casing,
--          abbreviations vs full names.
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────

-- 4.1 dept_name — known issue: "Prod." vs "Production"

-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────
-- SECTION 7: CROSS-COLUMN LOGIC CHECKS
-- Purpose: Catch contradictions that would corrupt
--          downstream KPIs like LTIFR and severity scores.
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────

-- 7.1 Near-miss flagged Y/1 but also has an injury type recorded
--     (near misses should have no actual injury)

-- SECTION 8: RISK SUMMARY BY SITE & DEPARTMENT
-- Purpose: Early signal of high-risk areas.
--          This is a preview of what the dashboard
--          will show — EDA validates it makes sense.
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────

-- 8.1 Incident summary by site
